# SVM Learning Project (C++ / OpenCV)

This project is a **C++ machine learning pipeline** using **OpenCV’s SVM implementation**.  
It demonstrates how to:

- Train an SVM model in C++
- Normalize features correctly
- Save the trained model and normalization statistics
- Reuse them later for monitoring / prediction

The project is built and run using **native Windows tools** (Visual Studio + CMake).

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Windows 10 / 11**
- **Visual Studio 2022 (Build Tools are enough)**
- **CMake (>= 3.20)**
- **OpenCV 4.x (compiled with MSVC)**

Make sure OpenCV is correctly installed and CMake can find it.

---

## 🛠️ Build Instructions (Native Command Line)

Open **Visual Studio 2022 Developer Command Prompt (x64)**.

```bat
cd C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\svm-learning

mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
msbuild svm-learning.sln /p:Configuration=Release

After this, executables will be located in:

build\Release\

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Train the SVM Model

```bat
cd build\Release
train_svm.exe



This step will:

- Load the dataset  
- Normalize features  
- Train the SVM  
- Save:
  - `data/norm_stats.yml`
  - `models/svm_model.yml`

⚠️ **You must run this first.**

## 🔍 Run the Monitor (Prediction)

```bash
monitor.exe
